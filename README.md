# Tailsitters-Forever
This is a place to store photos and text related to my efforts to design and build small vertical takeoff aircraft, and to learn about how GitHub works.
60 years of building airplanes, large and small, and sailing the world in our 46 foot cutter, which my wife and I built, have taught me some things, but unfortunately, not to code. I'll participate as I can- edit the wiki, act as builder for others who are interested in tailsitters or other projects,etc. but I fear coding is a long shot for me. But I'm a good builder.
My interest stems in part from my need to devise a way to fly from a wheelchair, and tailsitters are perhaps a solution--as well as fun.
