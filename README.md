# Tailsitters-Forever
A place to store photos and text related to my efforts to design and build small vertical takeoff aircraft.
60 years of building airplanes, large and small, and sailing the world in our 46 foot cutter has taught me some things, but unfortunately, not to code. I'll participate as I can- edit the wiki, act as builder for others who are interested in tailsitters or other projects, but I fear coding is a long shot for me. But I'm a good builder.
